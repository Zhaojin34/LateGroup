        <h2>2. Collaborative Workspaces</h2>
        <p>The group will be using trello to organize the project, (<a href="https://trello.com/b/TA3pkQ73/ar-fr-330-lategroup">https://trello.com/b/TA3pkQ73/ar-fr-330-lategroup</a>). We will communicate on a private Microsoft Teams chat, and files will be shared on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/patricksoliman/LateGroup">https://github.com/patricksoliman/LateGroup</a>) </p>
        <br>
        <h2>3. Communication Expectations</h2>
        <p>The group expects to talk on Microsoft Teams every 2 days to update other members on the progress made on their respective parts of the project. Furthermore, a weekly group meeting will be held and recorded on Microsoft Teams to clarify any queries between members – in hopes that the website will meet the project plan and expectations.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>4. Decision-making Processes</h2>
        <p>All decisions will be proposed by the team leader and voted/discussed within the team. The team has also agreed that a secondary vote cannot happen – this is to reduce confusion between the team, and allow the team to stay on schedule.</p>
