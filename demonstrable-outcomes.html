            <p>There are several web and mobile applications assisting people in scheduling their events, however, most of the former, and latter are aimed at a strictly professional lifestyle. Our application will use a combination of event planning, and general day-to-day management. The panda is to provide positive reinforcement – with the goal to ultimately support users in developing and maintaining good habits, to create a good balance between professional and personal events.</p>
            <p>The group knows how to code functions locally but have not built/run a web application prior to this. It is anticipated that the group will need to learn basic to moderate database/server principles.</p>
