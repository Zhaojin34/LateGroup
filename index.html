            <p>Our project will be a web app and its main idea is helping people to manage and plan their daily activity and long tern goals by increase their motivation. Every new user will adopt a panda as their partner. They can create several kinds of tasks, and every time they complete their tasks, they will receive experience and supplies. A panda will level up and evolve as user keep finishing their tasks, and users can further cultivate their partner with their supplies.</p>

            <p>Project Motivation</p>
            <p>There are several web and mobile applications assisting people in scheduling their events, however, most of the former, and latter are aimed at a strictly professional lifestyle. Our application will use a combination of event planning, and general day-to-day management. The panda is to provide positive reinforcement – with the goal to ultimately support users in developing and maintaining good habits, to create a good balance between professional and personal events.</p>
            <p>The group knows how to code functions locally but have not built/run a web application prior to this. It is anticipated that the group will need to learn basic to moderate database/server principles.</p>
